# Roadmap

DCMfx has no formal roadmap, but future additions are likely to include the
following:

- Encode JPEG XL pixel data

- Decode High-Throughput JPEG 2000 pixel data using OpenJPH as an alternative to
  the existing decoding with OpenJPEG
  
- Support precisions beyond 30 bits with High-Throughput JPEG 2000.

- Decode and encode JPEG-LS pixel data on WASM

- Encode/decode 1-bit monochrome JPEG 2000 pixel data

- DIMSE networking

- Decoding and encoding of waveform data

- Extraction of DICOM structured report data

- Creation of DICOMDIR indexes

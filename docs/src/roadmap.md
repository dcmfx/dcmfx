# Roadmap

DCMfx has no formal roadmap, but future additions are likely to include the
following:

- Read pixel data that uses the 'JPEG Extended (Process 2 & 4)' transfer syntax

- Transcode between a wider range of transfer syntaxes

- Overlay rendering

- DIMSE networking

- Decoding and encoding of waveform data

- Extraction of DICOM structured report data

- Creation of DICOMDIR indexes

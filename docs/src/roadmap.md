DCMfx has no formal roadmap, but future additions are likely to include the
following:

  the existing decoding with OpenJPEG
  
- Support precisions beyond 30 bits with High-Throughput JPEG 2000.

- Decode JPEG-LS pixel data on WASM

- DIMSE networking

- Decoding and encoding of waveform data

- Extraction of DICOM structured report data

- Creation of DICOMDIR indexes
